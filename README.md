The stock analyser is an automated n8n workflow using a Gemini AI Agent to provide a professional analysis for a stock ticker symbol entered in a chat. It generates a concise report covering technical analysis, fundamental highlights, a clear BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendation, key risks, and a rationale.
